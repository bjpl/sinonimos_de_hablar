# What is the difference between Hablar, Platicar, and Charlar?

Could someone explain to me the usages of the words Hablar, Platicar, and Charlar? I am of the impression that HABLAR would be the most formal, then PLATICAR, followed by CHARLAR, which is basically chattering... I'm I way off?

### 4 Answers

I think the difference is mainly regional, ie. some regions prefer to use one of those over the other.

They are pretty much synonymous though with platicar and charlar both meaning to chat and hablar literally meaning to speak but also able to be used as 'to chat'. It seems that this is the case with hablar especially in Spain whereas platicar seems more common in Latin America but hopefully you'll get some more input from native speakers

Hablar- to speak.

Placticar- to converse, similar to "conversar"

Charlar --to chatter, also converse.

I would like to add a fourth one "Cotorrear" This is the kind of chattering that girls like to do --very fast somewhat high- pitched, without stopping. It comes from "cotorra" a bird--the magpie (a parrot in some areas) that is known for doing all the above.

And now Real Academia en España has added CHATEAR to the chat words.

Thankya much! Do you ever look at the Real Academia de España? I couldn't seem to understand a difference between the first two.



### 5. Let's Talk About It: Your Full Guide to the “Hablar” Conjugation in ...

**URL:** https://www.clozemaster.com/blog/hablar-conjugation/

Let’s talk

*talking*: are you the kind of person that feels energized by a good conversation? Or do you need lots of quiet time after going out with friends? What about the kinds of conversations you like to have: do you like small talk? Gossip? Discussing the economy? The point is, there are as many ways of talking as there are people and moods, and it is important to be able to communicate well, no matter the context.

In today’s lesson, we’re going to learn about the Spanish verb

**hablar**, meaning *to talk, or to speak*. Over the course of this post, we’ll go over some key information on what kind of verb **hablar **is. We’ll also look at the different meanings of **hablar**, and lots of **hablar** conjugation for you to sink your teeth into. Once you’ve finished reading, there is a tailor-made Cloze collection at the bottom of this post for you to practice your new skills with.

So, without further ado, let’s talk!... ## What Kind of Verb is

*Hablar*?

*Drumroll, please*…

If you’ve been following these posts for a while, you’re probably so used to irregular verbs that you no longer get phased by them at all. If this is the case, you’re in for a surprise. The verb

**hablar **is a **regular **verb, meaning you’re about to have a much easier time. With regular verbs, conjugation is simpler and you can more intuitively fill in the blanks. Let me explain:

In Spanish, verbs always end either in

**ar **(like **sanar, ** *to heal*) *, er *(like *comer, * *to eat*), or *ir *(like **compartir**, *to share*). These verbs all have **stem **sections, which are the parts that come before **ar, er, **or **ir**. In **hablar**’s case, the stem is “ **habl**-”. What makes hablar a **regular **verb is that this stem never changes, no matter what tense or subject the verb is being conjugated with. This means that you can be 100% confident that in * hablar* conjugation, the verb will always start with “ **habl**-”, which cuts a lot of the guesswork out of the equation for you.

If you’re curious about other regular verbs, feel free to check out some other posts on this blog, like the one for

**comer **( *to eat)*, or **leer **( *to read*).... ## The Different Meanings of

*Hablar*

Now that we’ve established that

**hablar **is a regular verb, you can rest assured that you’re in for a pretty easy ride when it comes to this lesson. The only complication you’ll really be facing is how to parse out the different meanings of **hablar**. Lucky for you, if you already speak English, this is an absolute cakewalk. The verb **hablar** is a single verb that means both *to talk *and *to speak*.

While in English you’d have to navigate which one is correct based on context, Spanish is more chilled-out in this regard, so you’d always use

**hablar **no matter what. For example, if you wanted to ask *“Do you speak Italian?*”, you would say **“¿Hablas italiano?”. **Likewise, if you wanted to say *“Let’s go talk to him”*, you would say **“Vámonos a hablar con él.” **As you can see, there is no distinction between *to talk*, and *to speak *in Spanish, so you really have nothing to worry about when learning this verb!

*Hablar* Verbals

Because

**hablar **is a relatively easy verb to learn, learning its **verbal **forms only requires a solid understanding of what **verbals **are, so let’s start with that first. Despite their confusing name, **verbals **occur when verbs **don’t act like verbs **in a given sentence. Instead, they act as nouns, adjectives, or adverbs. This is usually because the sentence has a different active verb, so the inactive one is used just to make reference to an action, but not the one being undertaken within that sentence. Looking at some concrete examples will make this much clearer. Let’s take a look at three different verbal forms for **hablar**.... ### Participio (

*participle*)

Only one more verbal to go! The

*participle* of **hablar **is **“hablado”**, and this form is typically used when the active verb is **haber**, meaning *to have*. It is also used to organize compound verbs. As you will see in the compound verbs conjugation section later, the **participle **form reappears very frequently in Spanish conjugation. Here’s an example: **“¿Has hablado con tu abuela? Te está esperando.”**-> *“Have you spoken to your grandmother? She is waiting for you.”*

In this case, the active verb is actually

**haber**, and the conjugation “ **has hablado**” is a compound form of **hablar**, which is why the *participle *is used.

Now that we’ve covered verbals, the rest should be a breeze. Let’s do some proper

**hablar **conjugation!... ## Beginner

*Hablar* Conjugation

To begin these conjugation tables, let’s look at some of the most basic tenses for the verb

**hablar**. These are the *present * **(presente)**, the *past perfect * **(el perfecto)**, the *past imperfect * **(el imperfecto)**, and the *future * **(futuro)**. With these four tenses in the bag, you’ll be well on your way to mastering the verb **hablar **and talking everyone’s ear off!

- Future Perfect: “

**Estoy segura que ya habrán hablado con el médico cuando lleguemos.” ->** *“I’m sure that they’ll have already spoken to the doctor when we get there.”*... ## Conditional

*Hablar* Conjugation

Congratulations! You’re doing fantastically well. If you’re looking for one more tense to really add to your Spanish vocabulary, the conditional is where it’s at. With the conditional, you can express what would happen

*if *certain conditions are met. For example, you might want to tell a Spanish friend that you would speak Portuguese *if *you had the time to learn it. For that, you’d use a conditional form of the verb **hablar**. Let’s look at the simple *conditional * **(condicional**), and the *perfect conditional * **(condicional perfecto). **
