The verbs **cotorrear**, **parlar**, **parlotear**, **cuchichear**, and **murmurar** are all informal or colloquial Spanish verbs related to speaking, each with its own nuance and regional usage. Here’s a detailed breakdown, including their meanings, connotations, and how they fit into Latin American Spanish colloquial speech:

---

### 1. **Cotorrear**
- **Meaning:** To chat, gossip, or talk a lot, often in a lively or trivial way.
- **Connotation:** Informal, sometimes slightly pejorative (implies talking excessively or about trivial matters).
- **Usage:** Common in Mexico and other parts of Latin America. Example: *Estuvimos cotorreando toda la tarde* (“We were chatting/gossiping all afternoon”).
- **Colloquial context:** Used among friends or in casual settings to describe light, often aimless conversation[1][6].

---

### 2. **Parlar**
- **Meaning:** To talk, to speak.
- **Connotation:** Very informal, sometimes regional or archaic in standard Spanish, but still used in some areas (notably in Spain and some Latin American countries).
- **Usage:** Less common than the others, but can be heard in certain dialects or as a humorous or affected way to say “to talk.”
- **Colloquial context:** May be used playfully or to mimic old-fashioned or regional speech[1][6].

---

### 3. **Parlotear**
- **Meaning:** To chatter, to babble, to prattle.
- **Connotation:** Informal, often implies speaking quickly, incessantly, or about unimportant things.
- **Usage:** Used across the Spanish-speaking world. Example: *Los niños no paraban de parlotear* (“The kids wouldn’t stop chattering”).
- **Colloquial context:** Can be mildly negative, suggesting annoyance at the amount or quality of speech[1][6].

---

### 4. **Cuchichear**
- **Meaning:** To whisper, to speak in a low voice, usually so others cannot hear.
- **Connotation:** Neutral to informal, often used to describe secretive or conspiratorial speech.
- **Usage:** Common in both Spain and Latin America. Example: *Estaban cuchicheando en la esquina* (“They were whispering in the corner”).

### 5. **Murmurar**
- **Meaning:** To murmur, to mutter, to speak softly, often in complaint or disapproval.
- **Connotation:** Neutral to slightly negative, can imply gossip or speaking ill of someone in a low voice.
- **Usage:** Widely used in all Spanish-speaking regions. Example: *Murmuraban sobre el jefe* (“They were murmuring about the boss”).

## Additional Notes

- These verbs are not always interchangeable; context and regional usage matter.
- Many of these verbs have a slightly negative or playful connotation, often implying that the speech is trivial, secretive, or excessive.
- Latin American Spanish is especially rich in regional slang for talking, gossiping, and chatting, so local variants abound[1][3][4][7].
